What is an EMG Sensor?
An EMG (Electromyography) Sensor detects electrical signals produced by muscle movements.
These signals help analyze muscle activity and can be used in medical, sports, or human-machine interaction systems.

Components Used:
  • EMG Sensor Module
  • Electrodes (for muscle signal detection)
  • Arduino Uno (microcontroller)
  • 2 x 9V Batteries (power supply)
  • Laptop (to view real-time output via Serial Monitor)
  • Multimeter (To check Connectivity)

Working:
Electrodes are attached to the skin over a muscle (e.g. forearm). When the muscle contracts, the EMG sensor captures the small electrical signals generated. These signals are sent to the Arduino,
which processes and displays the data on the laptop. This project demonstrates how bio-signals can be captured and interpreted using basic electronics.

Purpose of This Project:
The goal of this project is to explore how human muscle activity can be measured and used in electronics projects. It serves as a foundation for applications like gesture control,
prosthetic limb control, and muscle fatigue monitoring.

Future Expansion
 • Add signal filtering and smoothing for cleaner output
 • Connect with machine learning models to classify muscle gestures
 • Control robotic arms or IoT devices using muscle movements
 • Visualize data using real-time graphs on a web or mobile interface
 • Implement wireless transmission using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
