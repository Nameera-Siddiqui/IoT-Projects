ðŸš¦ What is a Smart Traffic System?
A Smart Traffic Management System is an intelligent solution to control traffic flow efficiently at intersections. 
Instead of relying on fixed-time signals, it detects the amount of traffic on each road and dynamically adjusts the green light timing.
This helps reduce unnecessary waiting and improves road usage efficiency.

 Components Used
â€¢ ESP32 (microcontroller for logic control)
â€¢ 8 LEDs (2 for each road â€” 1 Red + 1 Green, for 4 roads total)
â€¢ Ultrasonic Sensors (for real-time traffic detection on each road)
â€¢ 4:1 Multiplexer (built using logic ICs)
â€¢ Jumper wires, Breadboard, and Power Supply

 Working:
The system simulates a 4-way intersection using 8 LEDs. Each road has a Red and Green LED representing its traffic signal.
Ultrasonic sensors are placed on each road to detect the presence of vehicles. These readings are sent to the ESP32, which controls the signals based on traffic density.
To handle traffic prioritization, a custom 4:1 Multiplexer circuit was designed using logic ICs. It selects the road with the highest traffic and allows it to go green while keeping others on red.
If no significant traffic is detected, the system falls back to a default mode, cycling through each signal for 15 seconds in a round-robin fashion â€” simulating a normal timer-based traffic system.

Ultrasonic sensors were chosen over IR sensors for better range and accuracy, keeping the prototype budget-friendly but practical.

Purpose:
The aim of this project is to build a cost-effective, scalable smart traffic system that mimics real-world traffic logic.
It demonstrates how basic electronics and embedded programming can be used to build intelligent urban systems, especially useful in developing cities.

Future Expansion:
Integrate ESP32-CAM to detect vehicle count using image processing
Use cloud platforms (like Firebase or Blynk) to log traffic data or provide remote monitoring
Add emergency vehicle detection to override the signal cycle
Expand to a multi-intersection smart city prototype
Develop a mobile app or web dashboard for traffic visualization
Implement AI-based traffic prediction using collected data
Optimize multiplexer logic with software-based priority queuing in ESP32
